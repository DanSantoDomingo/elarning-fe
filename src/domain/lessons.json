    "explanation": "A fraction is a mathematical concept used to represent a part of a whole or a ratio between two values. It is composed of two parts: a numerator (the top part) and a denominator (the bottom part). The numerator represents the number of parts of the whole, while the denominator represents the total number of parts into which the whole is divided.",
    "example": "Let's say you have a pizza and you want to share it with your 3 friends. You cut the pizza into 6 pieces. You can say that each friend gets 2 pieces of the pizza, which can be written as a fraction: 2/6. The numerator (2) tells you how many pieces of pizza each friend gets, and the denominator (6) tells you how many pieces the pizza was cut into. Another way to think about it is that each friend gets 2/6 of the pizza, or 1/3 of the pizza.",

    "explanation": "Simplifying a fraction means to write it in its simplest form, by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF). Reducing a fraction means to simplify it to its lowest terms. In other words, a fraction is reduced when its numerator and denominator have no common factors other than 1.",
    "example": "For example, the fraction 6/8 can be simplified to 3/4 by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their GCF of 2. It can be further reduced to its lowest terms by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their GCF of 3 and 4, which is 1. So the reduced form of the fraction 6/8 is 3/4.",

    "explanation": "To add or subtract fractions, the denominators (the bottom part of the fraction) must be equal. If they are not equal, the fractions must be first converted to have a common denominator. This is done by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators, and then multiplying the numerators and denominators of the fractions so that they have the same denominator. Finally, the numerators of the fractions are added or subtracted, and the result is written over the common denominator.",
    "example": "For example, to add the fractions 1/2 and 1/3, the LCM of 2 and 3 must be found, which is 6. So, the fraction 1/2 is converted to 3/6 and 1/3 is converted to 2/6. Now, the two fractions have the same denominator, and their numerators can be added to get 5/6. This is the final answer.",

    "explanation": "To multiply fractions, the numerators (the top part of the fraction) are multiplied and the denominators (the bottom part of the fraction) are multiplied. To divide fractions, one fraction is inverted (the numerator and denominator are swapped) and then multiplied by the other fraction. The result is the same as multiplying the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction.",
    "example": "For example, to multiply the fractions 2/3 and 1/4, the numerators are multiplied to get 2 * 1 = 2 and the denominators are multiplied to get 3 * 4 = 12.

Mixed numbers can be converted to improper fractions by multiplying the whole number by the denominator and adding the numerator. Improper fractions can be converted to mixed numbers by dividing the numerator by the denominator and writing the result as a whole number plus a fraction.",
    "example": "For example, to convert the mixed number 3 1/2 to an improper fraction, you would multiply the whole number 3 by the denominator 2 to get 6, and then add the numerator 1 to get 7. The final answer is 7/2. To convert the improper fraction 7/3 to a mixed number, you would divide the numerator 7 by the denominator 3 to get 2 with a remainder of 1. The final answer is 2 1/3.",

    "explanation": "Comparing fractions involves determining which fraction is larger or smaller than another fraction. To compare fractions, you can either cross-multiply the fractions to find an equivalent fraction with a common denominator or convert the fractions to decimals to compare their values. Ordering fractions involves arranging a set of fractions in ascending or descending order, from smallest to largest or largest to smallest.",
    "example": "For example, to compare the fractions 1/2 and 1/3, you can cross-multiply to find equivalent fractions with a common denominator, such as 3/6 and 2/6. Since 3/6 is larger than 2/6, you can conclude that 1/2 is larger than 1/3. To order a set of fractions, such as 1/3, 1/2, and 2/3, you can arrange them in ascending order to find that 1/3 is the smallest, followed by 1/2, and then 2/3 which is the largest.",

    "explanation": "Converting decimals to fractions involves expressing a decimal number as a fraction with a denominator of a power of 10. To do this, you can either write the decimal as a fraction with a numerator that is the decimal number multiplied by a power of 10, or use the place value of the decimal to determine the denominator. Converting fractions to decimals involves dividing the numerator by the denominator. The decimal representation of the fraction will have as many decimal places as the denominator has factors of 10.",
    "example": "For example, to convert the decimal 0.5 to a fraction, you can write it as a fraction with a numerator of 5 and a denominator of 10. The fraction 0.5 can also be represented as the fraction 5/10. To convert the fraction 3/4 to a decimal, you can divide the numerator (3) by the denominator (4) to get 0.75. The decimal representation of the fraction 3/4 has two decimal places, as the denominator 4 has two factors of 10.",

    "explanation": "The least common multiple (LCM) of two or more numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the numbers. The greatest common factor (GCF) of two or more numbers is the largest number that divides into all the numbers without leaving a remainder. Finding the LCM and GCF of two or more numbers is important for simplifying and reducing fractions, solving problems in real-world situations, and understanding mathematical concepts related to ratios and proportions.",
    "example": "For example, the LCM of 4 and 6 is 12, because 12 is the smallest number that is a multiple of both 4 and 6. The GCF of 4 and 6 is 2, because 2 is the largest number that divides into both 4 and 6 without leaving a remainder. If you want to simplify the fraction 8/12, you can divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCF of 8 and 12, which is 4, to get the simplified fraction 2/3.",
